#### Game of life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.It is a zero-player game,meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

###### Rules:
    1- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
    2- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
    3- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
